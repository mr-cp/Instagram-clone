Repository Title: Instagram Login Page Clone (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

Description:

This repository contains a clone of the Instagram login page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates the visual design of the official Instagram login page, providing a hands-on practice exercise for front-end development. Please note that this clone is for educational and practice purposes only and does not implement actual authentication functionality.

Features:

-> HTML structure mimicking the Instagram login page.
-> CSS styling to replicate the visual design.
-> JavaScript for basic interactivity and form validation.
-> Optional: Password visibility toggle, "Remember Me" checkbox (if included).

Usage:

-> Clone or download the repository.
-> Open index.html in a web browser to view the clone.
-> Experiment with the login form and interactivity.

Disclaimer:

This clone is intended for educational purposes and does not implement real authentication. For a production-ready login system, backend authentication is necessary.
